Hey, Orcas are pretty cool

And Borderlands 3 is a great game!

But it is also kind of hard to get into 

the game is pretty easy too, the grind is too real sometimes. Spending hours on end to farm a specific item is so draining. Especially when the chance is so high, 10% or so, and it just doesn't drop after the 50th run. Plus if you're on console, save quitting is so slow
